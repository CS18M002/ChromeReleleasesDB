    ('Admin Console Update','Tuesday, May 27, 2014','The Admin console has been updated. A new device setting allows admins to force devices to be re-enrolled to their Admin console, even after a device is wiped. At the startup screen after a wipe, user logins outside of the domain account and guest mode will be blocked. All devices with the policy enforced will force users to re-enroll to the Admin console until the admin deprovisions the device.This feature is enabled by default and currently requires devices to be enrolled on version 35 of Chrome OS in order to work. In a future update, all devices that are on the latest version will be compatible with this new policy. Devices that are eligible for forced re-enrollment will no longer work with automatic enrollment, and the policy to enable automatic enrollment will be removed from the Admin console in the near future.Known issues are available here.
